## OO Principles (from Head First Design Patterns)
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interface, not implementation
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification _(Open/closed principle)_
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes _(Dependency Inversion Principle)_
* Only talk to your friends _(Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge)_
* Don't call us, we'll call you _(Hollywood principle)_
* A class should have only one reason to change _(Single responsibility principle)_
